When you decide to use MVP architecture in your project, it is very tired create new modules, because you need create at least 5 files for each. I was suffering this problem, and this is the raison why I've created this template. It's very useful for me and I hope that for you too.

## How to install

### Download or clone file

- Go to folder MVP Template.

### Folder MVPTemplate
![](/assets/MVPFile.png)

### Using script (easy)
Only need execute this command in terminal:
```swift
sudo swift install.swift
```
Message:

![](/assets/successed.png)

If all it's ok you now could find your template in Xcode.

### Manual
Go to Application folder, browse to the Xcode application icon. Right-click it and choose 'Show Package Contents'. Then browse to:
`Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/iOS/Application` and add "Module MVP File.xctemplate" file. Now you can find your template in Xcode.
